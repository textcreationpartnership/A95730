1. A Table of the Scriptures, that are open'd more largely in this Book, and of the Queſtions that are grounded on them.

#####Body#####

1. Family-Inſtructions in the reſolving of Scripture-queſtions. Moſt of them out of the Proverbs of Solomon.

    _ Queſt. IF abundant Words (like a Well) be good: How then is there Sin in many words?

    _ Qu. IS it abſolutely unlawful to lay up Corn; or to keep it at any time from the Market?

      * Queſt. May I not take my opportunity to ſell when things be at the beſt Rate?

Obj. But if I with-hold to a dearer time, then the Market will be dearer at preſent than if I brought in, and ſo the poor will fare the worſe.

    _ Qu. WHat courſe ſhould Parents take to provide well for their Children?

    _ Qu. WHat Helps are there for that Chearfulneſs that Solomon ſo much commendeth?

    _ Qu. WHat Rules are there given by Solomon for Rulers and daintier Feaſts, and to keep us from being under the power of luſts fortified by ſuch Feaſts?

    _ Qu. VVHat Counſel doth Solomon give for the Reſtraint of worldly Luſts?

    _ Qu. WHat's Solomon's Advice concerning the Vice of Strife and Contention?

    _ Qu. VVHat is there in Fear that a Man for that ſhould be counted Happy?

      * Queſt. But how is it poſſible that Fear ſhould have ſuch an hand in Man's Happineſs?

    _ Qu. WHat hardneſs of heart is that whereby a Man falls into miſchief?

1. Scripture-Queſtions out of Eccleſiaſtes.

    _ Qu. WHat doth this whole Book hold forth to us concerning this Vanity?

      * Obj. Preachers ſay ſo, but Do wiſe Men think ſo?

    _ Qu. DOth Solomon abſolutely bind us out from ſaying, the former days are better than theſe, or from queſtioning the preſent times?

    _ Qu. VVHat's Solomon's drift in this double counſel? Or what doth he mean by [overmuch righteous] and [overmuch wicked]?

    _ Qu. IS it abſolutely ſo that all things come alike to all?

    _ Qu. ARe theſe the words of ſenſual Men; or, Are they Solomon's wiſe and ſerious Sayings?

      * Queſt. What difference is there then between Epicures and Frolicks; and Men that fear God in the free uſe of outward Enjoyments?

    _ Qu. SInce Solomon gives ſuch a liberty for not Vowing, it may be demanded what uſe there is eſpecially of Vowing, and what Grounds there are in Goſpel-times?

      * Obj. 1.] The Old Teſtament gives a ful liberty not to Vow, Deut 23. 22. And there is no mention of a Vow in the New Teſtament, ſave only of Paul's, (Acts 18. 18. & 21. 23, 24, 26.) which appertaineth to the Old-Teſtament-Service, and which he did undergo and yield to, not as required of God, but as willing to condeſcend to the Jews, in a thing wherein at that time there was an indifferency, for the winning of them the better to the Goſpel, by ſhewing his reſpect to the Law of which they were ſo zealous: What then is there in Scripture binding to Vowing?

      * Obj. 2.] But why ſhould any Vow be made for the keeping of Gods Moral Commandments, when it is impoſſible for us to obſerve them?

      * 
Obj. 3.] But if all be vowed in Baptiſm, then the thing is done, What need any more? The repeating thereof may be counted ſuperfluous.

      * Obj. 4.] God loves willingneſs, and that which is done freely: now Vows bind, and take away freedom.

Obj. But the Apoſtle ſaith, not of neceſſity, 2 Cor. 9. 7. and Vowing lays a neceſſity, and leaves no liberty of going back, Judg. 11. 35.

      * Obj. 5.] He that vows, lays a ſnare for himſelf, and brings upon himſelf a double guilt, if he fail: the one, in that he doth not that which he conceives himſelf in duty bound to do; the other, in that he hath broken a Vow whereby he tied himſelf to do it.

      * Obj. 6.] If it be required of God to make a Vow about things indifferent, then it is a ſin not to make it; But who will ſay, it is a ſin, not to Vow to obſtain from ſuch Meat or Drink, or not to Vow, after the receiving of a ſpecial mercy, to give, in way of thankfulneſs, ſuch or ſuch a portion to the Poor, or good uſes?

The Firſt Enquiry.

The Second Enquiry.

The Third Enquiry.

The Fouth Enquiry.

      * Queſt. In what manner is a Vow to be performed?

      * Queſt. What Helps be there for the performing of what is vowed rightly, though performed hardly?

Obj. Oh, but I have broken Vows!

1. Scripture-Queſtions out of Iſaiah.

    _ Qu. WHat's the reaſon why Chriſt is ſo often mentioned in the Promiſes of the Old Teſtament, and Prophecies of the outward deliverances of the Church?

    _ Qu. WHat courſe are we to take for Death-bed comforts?

      * Queſt. But how ſhall I that am weak and ill able to judg, be of Chriſts mind when ſo many differ about the mind of Chriſt?

      * Queſt. What ſhall we ſay to thoſe things wherein not only ordinary Perſons differ, but even the beſt Chriſtians, and the beſt Miniſters alſo?

      * Q. But if it be ſo dangerous and diſmal to go by the Law, and a Covenant of works, what muſt we go by then, to get comfort in the evil day?

      * Q. But how ſhall I know that I am in ſuch ſort in that Covenant.

Obj. But Hezekiah here ſeems to go by a Covenant of Works, for that he ſpeaks of is walking and doing?

    _ Q. VVhat's meant by Chriſts bringing forth judgment, and that unto truth or victory? for ſo it is ſaid, v. 1. He ſhall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. v. 3. He ſhall bring forth judgment unto truth.

    _ Q. Why doth the Lord by his Prophet Iſaiah (and otherwhere) ſpeak ſo much againſt Idolatry and Idolaters?

    _ Q. WHence is it that the bowing of every knee to God is ſo remarkably (yea with a Divine Oath) Propheſied of in this Text?

      * Obj. God is a Spirit, and in Goſpeltimes will be worſhipped in Spirit, Joh. 4. Calv. tract. Theolog. pag. 728. 23, 24. why then will not that ſuffice?

    _ Qu. HOw is Swearing an evidence and ſpecial character of ſubjection to, and owning of the true God?

      * Q. What Religion is there in an Oath?

Obj. Whatſoever is ſaid of this in the Old Teſtament, yet Chriſt in the New ſaith, Swear not at all, Mat 5. 34.

    _ Qu. VVhat is the Reaſon why ſo few have in all Ages, entertained the Goſpel?

      * Qu. How comes it to he thus hid?

    _ Q. HOw can it ſtand with the holy reverence of God that ought to be in the Servants of God, to faſten ſuch erring and heart-hardening upon him as this verſe expreſſeth?

      * Obj. But they ſeem not only to complain to God but of God?

1. Scripture-Queſtions out of JEREMIAH.

    _ Qu. How can Judah be ſaid to be worſe than backſliding, and (for their Sin) divorced and deſtroyed Iſrael; eſpecially in the days of Joſiah when there was ſo eminent a reformation?

    _ Qu. Whence is it, or what is meant by it, that it is ſaid, with ſuch variety of expreſſions, that when the People of God be multiplied and encreaſed in the Land, the Ark of the Lord ſhould be no more mentioned or minded?

    _ Q. VVHat's the way to Soul-reſt.

      * 1. Q. What is to be done to get reſt in Gods way?

      * 2. Qu. What is that Reſt and Peace that is ſo had?

    _ Qu. Did not God command the Paſſeover and other Sacrifices and ceremonial things in the old Teſtament?

    _ Q What may the meaning of theſe words be?

      * Q. What help is there to look encreaſing troubles in the face, and to bear up whenthe Sea of this world is moſt boiſterous?

    _ Q. How is it pſſible that ſo holy a manas Jeremy was ſhould ſpeak ſuch ſtrange and truculent words as theſe are, and that (as the Context hath it) immediately after his praiſing of God, and calling in others thereunto, ver. 13?

    _ Qu. When one Prophet ſaid one thing, and another did (with as much confidence) ſay a contrary thing, yea, when many ſpeak good, and one Jeremiah, evil; How could People know which to believe?

      * Obj. But if a ſinful people repent, good is ſtill promiſed in the whole Word of God, Deut. 4. 29, 30, 31.

    _ Q. Why ſhould the people of God ſeek and pray for the peace of Babylon wherein they were miſerable Captives?

    _ Qu. Whence is it that Jeremy ſpeaks of a new Covenant? what ſaith he of it, and how are we to judg of it?

      * Q. But had the Church of the Jews and the Servants of God in the Old Teſtament none of theſe things? How is it the ſame Covenant in ſubſtance, if they had not theſe Subſtantials?

      * Q. What then is the difference?

Obj. 1. It's ſaid expreſly, There was a Covenant made in Horeb, Deut. 5. 2. when they came out of Egypt, Exod. 19. 4, 5. yet that Covenant is now aboliſhed, Heb. 8. 9. 13. therefore it ſeems it was not the Covenantof Grace, for we know that is not now aboliſhed?

2 Obj. But we find other-where the very form of the Covenant of Works, viz. This do and live, Levit. 18. 5. Exod. 19. 5. Rom. 10. 5. Gal. 3. 12. Why ſhould a Covenant of Grace be ſet forth

in the very tenour and terms of a Covenant of Works?

3. Obj. That Covenant cannot be ſaid to be broken that was never made and ſtricken, but there was a Covenant differing from, and ſet on the other ſide of the Goſpel-Covenant that is ſaid to be broken, (and that's the Sinai-Covenant made with them when they came out of Egypt, Jer. 31. 34.) therefore a different Covenant was made and exiſtent in the Old Teſtament, and namely on Mount Sinai.

4. Obj. We find Gal. 4. 24. two Covenants expreſt.

5. Obj. In Heb. 8. 7, 8, 9. &c. there's a plain diſtinction of Covenants firſt and ſecond, and the Covenant which God made with them when he led them out o• the Land of Egypt, is ſaid to be eſtabliſhed on leſs excellent promiſes, yea to be faulty, and that which was to decay, wax old, and vaniſh away: can theſe things be ſaid of the Covenant of Grace? if not then there was another.

    _ Q. How could the People deliver themſelves, and ſo the King and City, into the hands of their and his greateſt enemy, and yet keep the fidelity they owed to their King?

      * Q. If falling to the Chaldeans were according to the will of God, why doth Jeremiah himſelf ſo paſſionately diſclaim that charge? Jer. 38. 13, 14.

      * Q. But what ſhall be ſaid to the Fugitives that fell to the Chaldeans, Jer. 38. 19. & 39. 9. are they to be commended?

    _ Qu. Did Jeremy do well in following the Kings command, and giving a ſliding anſwer to the Princes, or is he to be blamed for it?

    _ Q. How may it be brought to paſs that there ſhould be ſuch an Ʋnion as is her ſet before us in the conjunction of Iſrael and Judah?

    _ Q What are thoſe days, and what is that time whereof Jeremy here ſpeaks?

    _ Qu. Wherefore ſhould they go out of Captivity, and when they went to meet with God, weeping, when partings cauſe weepings and meetings joy, Joh. 16. 6, 22. with Matth. 28. 8. Pſal. 126. 6?

    _ Qu. Is it lawful for us to uſe ſuch imprecations as theſe? or what uſe is to be ade of them?

      * Obj. But the new Teſtament ſaith, Pray for them that deſpightfully uſe you and perſecute you, Mat. 5. 44. Rom. 12. 14. And Chriſt and Steven prayed for thoſe that kild them.

      * Q. What uſe may we make of thoſe prayers in Scripture which it is dangerous for us to imitate, who have not the Spirit or Patience of Prophets?
Ezek. 3. 20.When a Righteous man doth turn from his Righteouſneſs, and commit iniquity, and I lay a 
    _ Qu. How can God be ſaid to lay a ſtumbling-block before a Righteous man backſliding?

    _ Qu. How is God ſaid to give ſtatutes that were not good, and that tend to death; when all his Laws and commands ever were and are good, Nehem. 9. 13. Rom. 7. 12.

    _ Q. What may be conceived to be the reaſon of Daniels opening his windows in the time of prayer?

      * Q. But why then did not Daniel ſtandup againſt ſo ungodly a Decree, to hinder the malicious proceeding of the Princes in it, and the Kings blind aſſent to it?

      * Q But the queſtion is about the manner of doing, viz. with his windows open; what need that?

      * Qu. Firſt, In what caſe a publick and open Confeſſion may be forborn?

      * Q. Secondly, In what caſes is confeſſion required?
